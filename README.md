👋 Hi, I’m Jeewon Kim.
  
👀 I’m interested in data.
  
🌱 I’m currently learning Information Technology and Management in Seoul National University of Science and Technology, and Information Technology Management for Business in Northumbria University as a dual degree.
  
💞️ I’m based in Seoul, South Korea now, but my hometown is Mokpo, South Korea.
  
🇬🇧 I lived in London, United Kingdom for 2 years (2019-2021).
  
👗 I like buying new fashion items.
  
💭 I would like to become a cool data person.
  
✨ I believe inspiration is everywhere.
